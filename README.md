# login
Certainly! A sign-in page, also known as a login page, is a web page where users provide services they've previously signed up for.
Users typically enter their mobile number and email address and password to log in. 
If a user is not able to login by email or phone number by forgetting the password then also the user is able to login by forgetting password option .So that user can get OTP by Tradetrunk and be able to login . 
 If a user does not sign in, which means they have no account , it will show like “YOU HAVE NO ACCOUNT ,NEED TO SIGN UP” and moves to the sign up page ..where the user needs to create a new account.
